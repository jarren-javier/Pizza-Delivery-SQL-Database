# Pizza-Delivery-SQL-Database

**Project Description:**
<br /> The purpose of this project was to generate a pizza delivery database using SQL and populate it with randomized customer transactions. Business queries were generated to gain insight on business operations, business performance, and customer preferences. There are six different tables in this database including: Pizza, Order, Customer, Side, OrderDetail, and Employee. All data in this project is fictional and was randomized in Excel. The SQL code to generate and populate the tables are included in the SQLData Folder. A PDF presentation covering the findings in the data is also available.
<br />
<br />

- 6 Tables : Pizza, Side, Customer, Employee, Order, and OrderDetail

- Monthly Sales Report show sales volume in February was a little slower, resulting in the decrease in sales at 47k.
- The average range of sales is around 10k-12k and we can see there was a slight increase in sales in week 4 and 9. Here we see sales saw a spike in 14k and 13k total revenue.

- The order and revenue breakdown by each city shows that Santa Clara provides the most volume of orders and revenue. 
- We may also need to increase marketing in San Jose to get the volume of orders up.

- Monday is our busiest days. Weekend sales look to be suffering, increased promotions or marketing during these days is recommended.

- San Jose customers favor meat pizzas the most. Santa Clara and Milpitas look to have a more even distribution of meat and cheese preferences for their pizzas.
- We can offer more targeted promotions based off pizza preference by city

**Recommendations**
1) Increase marketing in the city of San Jose to get the volume of orders  and revenue to increase
2) Create new promotions to help drive weekend sales and push popular pizza/side pairings
3) Increasing staffing on Mondays and during the hours of 13:00-17:00 to accommodate for a busier schedule
4) Send out special promotions/rewards to top 10 customers to encourage their continued business 
5) Juliet Dennett should receive a $100 bonus for most amount of deliveries completed
